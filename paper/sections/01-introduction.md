So far we have learned bash, markdown, pandoc, github and Make. I would like to use vim as a text editor to write this paper. I would also use my own words to explain what are those computational tools and  the role of those  play in reproducible workflow. 
Next, I will introduce 5 tools in Discussion section: 

* Makefile
* Git
* Github
* pandoc
* Markdown
