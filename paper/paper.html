<p>This paper is introduction about the computational tools covered so far in Stat159 Fall2016.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">#Introduction</h2>
<hr />
<p>So far we have learned bash, markdown, pandoc, github and Make. I would like to use vim as a text editor to write this paper. I would also use my own words to explain what are those computational tools and the role of those play in reproducible workflow. Next, I will introduce 5 tools in Discussion section:</p>
<ul>
<li>Makefile</li>
<li>Git</li>
<li>Github</li>
<li>pandoc</li>
<li>Markdown</li>
</ul>

<p>In this section, we will talk about five computational tools: the role they play.</p>
<h1 id="makefile">Makefile</h1>
<hr />
<p>Sometimes it's very tedious to compiling many code files from different sources. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile"><em>Makefile</em></a> is a special format file that together with the <em>make</em> utility will help you to automatically build and manage your projects.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The basic makefile is composed of <em>target</em>, <em>dependencies</em>, and <em>system command</em> for example:</p>
<pre><code>all: file1.txt file2.txt

file1.txt:
    touch file1.txt

file2.txt: file1.txt
    mkdir newdirectory
    cd newdirectory
    cp file1.txt file2.txt

clean: 
    rm file1.txt
    rm file2.txt</code></pre>
<p>In this example, <em>all</em> is a tartget in the first line, and <em>file1.txt</em>, <em>file2.txt</em> are the dependencies. <em>all</em> is the target that all the main things you want to be executed (main target first to be executed). The <em>make</em> utility will execute this target with <em>file2.txt</em> dependencies. We also see that the target <em>all</em> has only dependencies <em>file1.txt</em> and <em>file2.txt</em> but no system commands. Therefore, it has to meet all the dependencies of the called target.</p>
<p>In this example, we also see a target called <em>clean</em>. The target <em>clean</em> does not have dependency. It is useful to have such target if you want to have a fast way to get rid of all the object files and executables. This example is basically when you run:</p>
<pre><code>make</code></pre>
<p>It creates a new directory and a new file1.txt, and then it copies file1 to file2 and then remove both file1.txt and file2.txt.</p>
